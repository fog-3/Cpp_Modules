# 42 CPP Modules

This repository contains my solutions to the C++ modules from the [42 School](https://42.fr/) curriculum. The CPP modules are a series of projects designed to teach and reinforce Object-Oriented Programming concepts in C++.

## About the 42 CPP Modules

The CPP modules are part of the core 42 cursus and cover the following topics:

- **Module 00:** Basic syntax, compilation, and simple I/O
- **Module 01:** Memory management, references, and pointers
- **Module 02:** Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and canonical form
- **Module 03:** Inheritance and abstract classes
- **Module 04:** Subtype polymorphism, interfaces, and exceptions

Each module consists of several exercises that progressively introduce new C++ features and best practices.
